## Introduction

The **Wearable Glove-Controlled Soft Robotic Gripper** is designed to mimic human hand movements and manipulate objects effectively. This project integrates:
- **Wearable technology**: A glove embedded with flex sensors to capture finger movements.
- **Wireless communication**: Data transmission via Wi-Fi to control the gripper.
- **Soft robotics**: A five-fingered gripper made of Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), actuated pneumatically for flexible and adaptive grasping.

## Features

- **Wearable Glove**: Equipped with flex sensors to capture finger positions in real time.
- **Wi-Fi Signal Transmission**: Sends data from the glove to the gripper using ESP32 modules.
- **Soft Robotic Gripper**:
  - Five pneumatically actuated fingers.
  - Molded using **Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)**.
  - 3D-printed molds and SolidWorks modeling.
- **Wireless Control**: Seamless operation without physical connections between the glove and the gripper.

## Design and Materials

### Glove:
- **Flex Sensors**: Embedded into the glove to measure finger bending.
- **ESP32 Module**: Sends data to the gripper via Wi-Fi.

### Gripper:
- **Material**: Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS).
- **Design**: Five-fingered structure modeled in SolidWorks.
- **Molding**: 3D-printed molds were used to shape the gripper fingers.
- **Actuation**: Pneumatically operated fingers for adaptable grasping.

## Hardware and Software

### Hardware:
- ESP32 modules (2 units)
- Flex sensors (5 units)
- Pneumatic valves
- PDMS for gripper fabrication
- 3D printer for mold creation
- Compressor for pneumatic actuation

### Software:
- Arduino IDE for ESP32 programming
- SolidWorks for gripper design
- Canva for presentation and documentation

## Code Overview

### Glove Code:
- Reads flex sensor data.
- Maps sensor values.
- Transmits data via Wi-Fi.

### Gripper Code:
- Receives Wi-Fi data from the glove.
- Controls pneumatic valves based on sensor inputs.

## How It Works

1. The **flex sensors** on the wearable glove capture finger bending positions.
2. The sensor readings are mapped and sent to the gripper via **Wi-Fi** using ESP32 modules.
3. The gripper ESP32 receives the data and actuates pneumatic valves to move the corresponding soft robotic fingers.
4. The gripper mimics the hand movements of the glove in real time.
